## Project Overview

The **Advanced Light Intensity Indicator (ALII)** is an innovative solution designed to monitor and indicate light intensity levels, providing an average intensity reading over a specified period. This module plays a crucial role in energy conservation by offering real-time data on light intensity, enabling more efficient use of artificial lighting systems. 

Moreover, the ALII module contributes to public safety by ensuring adequate lighting in urban spaces, potentially preventing accidents and deterring criminal activity. When integrated with solar panels, the system becomes self-sustaining, using renewable energy for continuous monitoring and energy conservation.

## Features

1. **Light Intensity Measurement and Display**:
   - A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) senses light intensity levels.
   - These levels are displayed on a seven-segment display, with values ranging from **"0"** (lowest) to **"7"** (highest).
   
2. **Stability Detection**:
   - To prevent sudden fluctuations in the output, the system displays light intensity only when it has remained stable for a certain period.
   - This delay period can be adjusted between **30 and 300 seconds** using a variable resistor.
   - A switch is included to enable or disable this stability feature.

3. **Average Light Intensity Display**:
   - An additional seven-segment display provides the average light intensity over a longer period, adjustable between **300 and 900 seconds**.
   - A variable resistor allows users to modify this period, while a push button resets the average reading, ensuring flexible and comprehensive light condition tracking.
